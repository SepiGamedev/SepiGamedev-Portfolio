                    Hello, my name is Sepi, and I’m a hobbyist game developer from Argentina. 
                    I like twisting familiar game genres and mechanics to make weird and unique 2D experiences. 
                    Most of my games are made with the Unity engine and programmed on C#. 
                    To make games I also use Gimp or Aseprite for the graphics, and Audacity or BFXR for the sound effects. 
                    The music of my games is made by the amazing 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfjIJVPPV8M" class="anim">Leonardo Muller-Rodriguez</a>
                    , a talented musician from the UK. 
                    My favorite aspect of game developing is the game design, but I also enjoy writing weird stories. 
                    I really love participating on gamejams and working with different limitations like a set color pallet, theme or mechanic. 
                    I also have a sweet tooth and LOVE eating cake. 
                    Although I’m most familiar with the C# language, I’m currently learning Python, HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
                    All my games are listed below, but you can also check my itch page 
                    <a href="https://sepigamedev.itch.io" class="anim">HERE</a>. 
                    It is nice to meet you, and I’m always happy to talk about games with anyone, you can add me on my discord: Sepi#8959. 
                    I hope you enjoy my weird little games!
                </p>

                        Final Fanta-Three is a Highscore Minigame inspired by the classic Gameboy. 
                        With the gameboys 4 color palette, switch between three heroes, each with his own strengths and weaknesses to defeat the hordes of monsters and beat your high scores.
                        This is my first game ever made and I still love it to this day. Most people say it's too hard... Most people are weak...
