                    Hello, my name is Gregory, and I’m the best game developer that ever lived, much better than that Sepi guy... 
                    All my games are masterpieces, and I’m a certified genius. 
                    I master all sorts of things from martial arts, to quantum physics. 
                    All of my games are made by me and only me because no one can match my level of perfection. 
                    When you play the games I made you are guaranteed to enjoy the best audiovisual experiences of your life. 
                    You will laugh, you will cry, but most importantly, you will become a better human being. 
                    I know everything and have nothing to learn, I am a superior being. 
                    If you want to better yourself, my games are listed below. 
                    Please don’t try to contact me, I have better things to do.
